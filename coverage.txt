test_concat.cpp
    The coverage for this test is inadequate as it does not account for empty string,
    commas, or numbers within the string.

test_equality.cpp
    The coverage for this test is almost complete, however, the max value is not covered.
    Additionally, the subscript operator is not tested. Furthermore, the final two tests
    repeat the same test by flipping the variables to different sides of the == operator.
    This is completely unnecessary, unless this was testing that operator or there was
    suspicion that it did not work.

test_cstring_ctor.cpp
    The coverage for cstring is terrible. It does not account for string size of one,
    typical, and max. Additionally, the test for the default is poorly constructored
    as the constructor for string does not run completely. ("") should not be included
    to constructor the default string. Finally, length() should not be used to test
    the empty string due to it not functioning for an empty string.

test_default_ctor.cpp
    First off length() should not be included in the default string test. The default test
    could use a == test for another empty string and a string with some content.
